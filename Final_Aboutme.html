        My Story in a Nutshell
      </h2>
      <p>
        I hail from the vibrant city of Orlando, Florida, and my academic journey commenced
         at Florida A&M University in the fall of 2015. Yes, it's been quite a journey, marked by 
         twists and turns that have shaped my path over the years.
         <br>
         Throughout my time at FAMU, I actively engaged in various organizations that enriched my 
         collegiate experience. I was a proud member of Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity, 
         the National Society of Black Engineers, and the Chance to Impress Mentor Program. My involvement
          extended beyond participation; I assumed several leadership roles that defined my journey—serving 
          as Miss Black for the FAMU chapter of Progressive Black Men Inc., holding secretarial responsibilities 
          for Chance to Impress, and taking on diverse roles such as Service Chair, Professional Development Chair, 
          and Vice Regent for the Phi Delta chapter of Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity. Additionally, 
          I contributed my skills and insights as a member of the Student Engineering Leadership Board and the #LetsStartHere 
          committee.
          <br>
          Finally, the culmination of this incredible journey approaches as I am set to graduate in the fall of 2023 from Florida 
          A&M University. The anticipation of this achievement fills me with excitement and gratitude for the transformative experiences 
          that have shaped my collegiate years.

As one chapter ends, another promising one begins, and I can't wait to share the next steps of my journey with you.

        Through  My Lens: Passion and Creativity
      </h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the semster, I have had to rediscover my passion for creativity. In all honesty, 
        my creative spark lay dormant since my high school days, a chapter now closed for quite a few years. 
        The revival of my creativity emerged unexpectedly during an Intro to Programming Course for Apple products. 
        It was a deep dive within myself, a rediscovery of the artistic potential I thought I had left behind.
      </p>

        Creative Process Unveiled:
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        My ultimate drive, however, stems from the practicalities of life – setting myself up financially. Balancing 
        college life and preparing for the next steps often relegated hobbies and creativity to the back burner. Yet, 
        amidst the hustle, creativity became an unexpected stress reliever, a respite from the demands of academia.
        Therefore my creative process has relied on spontaneity. Ideas don't manifest until I push pen to paper—or 
        in this case, iPad. The act of creation becomes a dynamic dance between the unexpected and the deliberate. Each 
        stroke, each pixel, is a testament to the fusion of the unplanned and the intentional.
